## Maps

Maps are used to represent a **collection of _related_ properties**

- All _keys_ and _values_ must be same type
- _Keys are indexed_ (can iterate over them)
- Don't need to know all keys at compile time
- **Reference type**

  <hr>

## Structs

Structs are used to represent a **collection with lots of _different_ properties**

- Values can be of _different type_
- Keys _don't support indexing_
- Need to know all the different fields at compile time
- **Value type**
